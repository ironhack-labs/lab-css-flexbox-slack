# CSS | Slack clone with Flexbox

## Introduction

**Slack** is a cloud-based set of team collaboration tools and services, or in simpler terms, an online chat application.

We use the Slack app almost every day to keep our communications with our classmates and the **Ironhack** team, but today we will be focusing on their landing page. In today's lab, we'll recreate Slack's landing page while ensuring it's responsive and adapts well to different screens. You can see the web page that we will be cloning [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/k77VYVA70WcPYRLvg4QmIf/LAB-CSS-Slack-Clone?node-id=125%3A3&scaling=scale-down-width&page-id=125%3A2&starting-point-node-id=125%3A3&hide-ui=1).


The goal of the lab is to create a *responsive* landing page using **CSS** and **Flexbox**.

## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Create a Pull Request so that your TAs can check your work.



## Instructions

The `starter_code` folder contains all the files you'll need. The `images` folder contains all the images you'll need for your page, although most of them are already displayed on the page.

**The `index.html` already contains all the text and content needed.  We will be focusing on the CSS and styling!**

During each iteration, the first step you should do is to inspect the provided screenshots. These are included in each iteration, along with a preview of the final result. Use these as a starting point for implementing your styles.

## Iteration 0 | Introduction to Figma

The first step during every iteration will be to inspect the design files. These were created using Figma and are usually handed off to developers by designers. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is a web-based UI (User Interface) design tool, used for creating design prototypes for websites and applications.

Figma is great because it allows designers and developers to collaborate on projects while also making it simple to share and preview web page designs.

When you begin working as a developer, your team will likely use Figma to hand off to you the designs of the features you will be asked to create. We're going to assume you've never seen Figma before, so don't worry. The following short videos should get you up to speed:

### Iteration 1 | Mobile Screens (width < 768px)

Mobile first right? :wink: 

We will start by focusing on the styles for mobile screens first! :iphone: Oh! Remember to use **Flexbox** to create the layout and display the content in rows or columns from the start. You'll be working on adapting the layout to different screen sizes in the following iterations, so it's essential that you start using Flexbox from start to end!



<br>

When done, your page should look like this: [Preview - Mobile](https://www.figma.com/proto/k77VYVA70WcPYRLvg4QmIf/LAB-CSS-Slack-Clone?node-id=68%3A2762&scaling=scale-down&page-id=68%3A2761&starting-point-node-id=68%3A2762&show-proto-sidebar=1&hide-ui=1)

<br>

Use the following page screenshot as the guide:

### Iteration 2 | Small Screens (width > 768px and width < 1024px)

Let's start growing our screen size. In this iteration, you will work on making the website look great on small screens (iPads, tablets, or larger smartphones). You will have to use CSS [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) to apply the style and layout changes. Take a look at the preview and the screenshot to see the changes that are needed. Your task is to work on the following:
- The **header** should go from 1 column to display 2 columns: one with the content and buttons, and the other with the image.
- The **company logos** should be displayed in a single row.
- The **images** in the sections in the **main** part should be fully displayed and aligned to the left or right side of the page, respectively.
- The **section "Teams large and small rely on Slack"** should have the list items and the buttons displayed horizontally as rows.
- The **sub-footer** items, previously displayed as a column, should now be displayed in a single row.

<br>

When done, your page should look like this: [Preview - Small Screens](https://www.figma.com/proto/k77VYVA70WcPYRLvg4QmIf/LAB-CSS-Slack-Clone?node-id=49%3A1508&scaling=scale-down&page-id=68%3A2976&starting-point-node-id=49%3A1508&hide-ui=1)

### Iteration 3 | Medium Screens (width > 1024px and width < 1440px)

We'll continue by focusing on devices with medium-sized screens (notebooks and bigger tablets). Similar to the previous iteration, you will have to use CSS media queries to apply the style and layout changes. The most noticeable changes in this viewport size are:
- The **navbar** should now display all the menu links. The previously displayed menu icon should now be hidden.
- The **sections** in the **main** part should now display the content in 2 columns: one column for the heading and text, and the other for the image.
- The **section "Welcome to your new digital HQ"** should now have the buttons displayed horizontally as rows.

<br>

When done, your page should look like this: [Preview - Medium Screens](https://www.figma.com/proto/k77VYVA70WcPYRLvg4QmIf/LAB-CSS-Slack-Clone?node-id=49%3A2159&scaling=scale-down&page-id=68%3A2977&starting-point-node-id=49%3A2159&hide-ui=1)

### BONUS: Iteration 4 | Large Screens (width > 1440px)

Last one! Some small changes and we are done! In this iteration we are targeting large-screen devices such as desktops and laptops:
- The **signup buttons** in the **header** should now be displayed horizontally, next to each other.
- Additionally, the image shown in the **header** should be centered and fully visible.

<br>

When done, your page should look like this: [Preview - Large Screens](https://www.figma.com/proto/k77VYVA70WcPYRLvg4QmIf/LAB-CSS-Slack-Clone?node-id=49%3A2489&scaling=scale-down&page-id=68%3A2978&starting-point-node-id=49%3A2489&hide-ui=1)

## FAQs

<br>

<details>
  <summary>I am stuck in the exercise and don't know how to solve the problem or where to start.</summary>
  <br>

  If you are stuck in your code and don't know how to solve the problem or where to start, you should take a step back and try to form a clear question about the specific issue you are facing. This will help you narrow down the problem and come up with potential solutions.


  For example, is it a concept that you don't understand, or are you receiving an error message that you don't know how to fix? It is usually helpful to try to state the problem as clearly as possible, including any error messages you are receiving. This can help you communicate the issue to others and potentially get help from classmates or online resources. 


  Once you have a clear understanding of the problem, you will be able to start working toward the solution.

  <summary>How do I center align HTML text elements?</summary>
  <br>

  To center align HTML *text elements*, you can use the `text-align` property and set it to `center`. This property can be applied to any *inline* or *block-level* element.

Here is an example of how you can use the `text-align` property to center align multiple text elements:

**HTML**

```html
<div>
  <h2>This is a title</h2>
  
  <p>This is some text in here</p>
</div>
```

**CSS**

```css
/* CSS */

p {
  text-align: center; /* Center align all p elements */
}

h2 {
  text-align: center; /* Center align all h2 elements */
}
```

This will center align all `p` and `h2` elements within the parent `div`.

For more information, check: [W3C: Centering Things](https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/center.en.html)

<details>
  <summary>How do I center align HTML block elements?</summary>
  <br>

  To center align a block-level element, such as a `div`, `h1`, etc., you can use the `margin` property and set it to `auto`. This will center the element horizontally within its parent container. 

Here is an example of how you can do this:

**HTML**

```html
<section>
  <div>
    <p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit.</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

**CSS**

```css
/* CSS */

div {
  width: 500px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

This will set the `width` property of the `div` to 500 pixels and we set the left and right margins to be equal by using `margin: 0 auto;`.

  <summary>How do I center align an HTML image element?</summary>
  <br>

  There are a few ways you can center align an image element.

##### 1. Align an image using `text-align`

To center an image element in HTML, you can use the `text-align` property on the parent element, such as `div`. Example:

**HTML**

```html
<div>
  <img src="https://placehold.co/300x150.png" />
</div>
```

**CSS**

```css
div {
  text-align: center;
}
```

This will center align all the children elements within the `section` element, including the `img` element.

<br>

##### 2. Align an image as a block element

The other way is converting the image into a block element and using `margin: 0 auto`. Here is an example:

**HTML**

```html
<section>
  <img src="https://placehold.co/300x150.png" />
</section>
```

**CSS**

```css
img {
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

This will center the image horizontally within the parent `section` element. The `display: block` property is used to make the image a *block-level* element, allowing the `margin: 0 auto` property to work. The `margin: 0 auto` property sets the left and right margins to be equal, centering the element within its parent container.

<details>
  <summary>How can I center align elements within a Flexbox container?</summary>
  <br>
To center align elements within a Flexbox parent container, you can use the `justify-content` property and set it to `center`. This will horizontally center the elements within the Flexbox container. 

**Example:**

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; /* Center elements horizontally */
}

```



You can also use the `align-items` property and set it to `center` to vertically center align the elements within the Flexbox container.

Example:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;  /* Center elements horizontally */
  align-items: center;      /* Center elements vertically */
}
```

  <summary>How can I change the header from having 1 column to having 2 columns using Flexbox?</summary>
  <br>

  To change the header of an HTML page from having one column to having two columns using Flexbox, you should do the following in your CSS:

1.  Use the `display` property and set it to `flex`. 
2.  Add the `flex-direction` property and set it to `column` to arrange the elements in a column. 
3.  Add the `justify-content` property to align the elements horizontally 
4.  Use the `align-items` property to align them vertically.

```css
header {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column; /* Arrange elements in a column */
  justify-content: space-between; /* Align horizontally */
  align-items: center; /* Align vertically */
}
```

To make the header responsive and change it to a two column layout on screens that are wider than 800 pixels, use a media query and set the `flex-direction` property to `row`:

```css
@media (min-width: 800px) {
  header {
    flex-direction: row;
  }

  /* Change the width of nested div elements */
  header > div {
    width: 50%;
  }
}
```

On smaller screens, the header will maintain a single column layout, but on screens larger than 800 pixels wide, it will change to a two column layout.

  <summary>Why are my media query styles not displaying properly on my browser?</summary>
  <br>

  When using media queries to create a responsive layout, it is recommended to start with the default styles for mobile (smaller) screens, and then use media queries at the end of your stylesheet to apply styles for each increasing viewport size.



There are a few possible reasons why your media query styles may not be properly displayed on your browser.

1. Check that you already have default styles for mobile screens, where applicable. These styles should be placed at the beginning of your stylesheet, before your media queries.
2. Make sure you have placed your media queries at the end of your stylesheet after your regular styles. This is because media queries are applied after regular styles, so if you place them before your regular styles, they will be overridden.
3. Make sure that you have the correct syntax in your media query. The correct syntax is `@media (expression) {...}`.
4. Make sure that you are using the correct media query expression. For example, if you are trying to target screens that are wider than 800 pixels, you should use the `min-width` in your expression, like this: `@media (min-width: 800px) {...}.`

  <summary>I am unable to push changes to the repository. What should I do?</summary>
  <br>

There are a couple of possible reasons why you may be unable to *push* changes to a Git repository:

1. **You have not committed your changes:** Before you can push your changes to the repository, you need to commit them using the `git commit` command. Make sure you have committed your changes and try pushing again. To do this, run the following terminal commands from the project folder:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Your commit message"
  git push
  ```
2. **You do not have permission to push to the repository:** If you have cloned the repository directly from the main Ironhack repository without making a *Fork* first, you do not have write access to the repository.
To check which remote repository you have cloned, run the following terminal command from the project folder:
  ```bash
  git remote -v
  ```
If the link shown is the same as the main Ironhack repository, you will need to fork the repository to your GitHub account first, and then clone your fork to your local machine to be able to push the changes.

Note: You may want to make a copy of the code you have locally, to avoid losing it in the process.
